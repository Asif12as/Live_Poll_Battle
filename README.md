## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Server Setup
1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/Asif12as/Live_Poll_Battle.git
cd live-poll-battle

2. Install server dependencies:
cd server
npm install

3. Start the server:
npm run dev

The server will run on http://localhost:5000.

### Client Setup
1. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the client directory:
cd ../client

2. Install client dependencies:

3. Start the client:
npm start

The client will run on http://localhost:3000 and should automatically open in your browser.

## How It Works

### Technical Architecture

This application uses a client-server architecture with WebSockets for real-time communication:

- **Frontend**: React.js for the UI, Socket.io client for real-time communication
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, Socket.io for WebSocket connections

### Vote State Sharing and Room Management

The application implements a real-time state synchronization approach:

1. **Room Management**:
   - Rooms are stored in an in-memory object on the server
   - Each room has a unique ID (6-character alphanumeric code)
   - Rooms store information about the poll question, options, users, and voting status
   - When a room is created, a timer starts that will automatically close voting after 60 seconds

2. **Vote State Sharing**:
   - When a user votes, the vote is sent to the server via WebSocket
   - The server updates the room's vote count and marks the user as having voted
   - The server then broadcasts the updated vote state to all connected users in that room
   - All clients receive the update and re-render their UI to show the current results
   - Votes are also stored in the user's browser localStorage to prevent re-voting if they refresh

3. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Socket.io enables bidirectional, event-based communication
   - The server broadcasts events for votes, timer updates, user joining/leaving, and reactions
   - Clients listen for these events and update their local state accordingly
   - The React UI re-renders automatically when the state changes

This architecture allows for a seamless real-time experience where all users see the same poll state at the same time, without requiring any manual refresh.
